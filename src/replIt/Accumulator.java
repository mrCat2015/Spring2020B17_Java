Write a class named Accumulator containing:
An instance variable named sum of type integer.

A constructor that accepts an integer parameter,
whose value is used to initialize the sum instance variable.

A method named getSum that returns the value of sum.
A method named add that accepts an integer parameter.

The value of sum is increased by the value of the parameter.
A method named remove that accepts an integer parameter.
The value of sum is decreased by the value of the parameter.

Override a toString method so it returns 'Sum is: X' where X is the sum instance variable
